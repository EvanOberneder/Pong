# Pong
Java Pong game made with LibGDX by Evan Oberneder.

Description:
Pong was made using the LibGDX java game development framework.  The game includes a menu screen, and a One and Two player game option featuring a bot to play against.  Includes instructions and a special mode to make gameplay faster and more intense.  Music is by David Fesliyan.
This was my first LibGDX project and I did the physics of the ball myself, so it may be glitchy sometimes. I am working on a completely different game using Box2D to handle physics which will also have cleaner more concise code.

⭐ To see game code, follow TwoPlayerGames -> core -> src -> me/obergames -> game or screens. ⭐

I hope you enjoy!
